## General Info
This application takes in the data from the form and displays the task information below the collapsible form. The task can then be removed when completed. It's not a complcated application, but worth the time it took to complete as much was learned about developing an application during its completion.

## Technologies Used
Some of the development technologies used to create the project include:
* Json-server
* Sass
* ReactJS
* React Router
* React Hook Form
* And, of course, JavaScript, with all the amazing ES6 features.
## Features
* Open or collapse the form to add the task data.
* Form data validation of the input fields against a regex pattern that follows the example given for each field.
* Saving of task data in a json file on a mock server using Json-server.
## Setup
There's really not much involved in setting up the project. Of course, Node and npm must be install After those have been verified to be working, just download the project and run:
```
npm install
```
to install all the necessary dependencies to run the project. 
## Usage
Once the setup of the project has been completed, the json-server storing the task data must be started first. The npm script is set in the package.json configuration is set to run with:
```
npm run server
```
Then once that has been started, start the development server with:
```
npm start
```
If a user just wants to finish off the project without further development, run:
```
npm build
```
and follow the instructions from there.
## Project Status
This project is essentially completed and any further work will be for anybody else who would like to run with the code and do something else interesting with it. This was mostly a learning project.
## Room for Improvement
There are many areas where this project can be improved, but ,as this project has been mainly a learning project, there really isn't any need to do so. Please do whatever any may want to improve the project.
## Acknowledgements
This project is based on a youtube tutorial watched while learning web development. It was originally based on code written while watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) video. The code has been altered quite a lot since originally working through that video.
